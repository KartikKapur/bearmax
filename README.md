# Bearmax

Bearmax is a Facebook chatbot that allows the user to diagnose themselves without having to go to a doctor's office. By utilizing Apimedic's api and Facebook's graph api/messenger toolkit, we were able to create a user-friendly way for patients to diagnose themselves (with a certain margin of error) and see if it was worth it to go through the hassle of making a doctor's appointment.
